# Game Engine
This is a game engine I wrote from scratch in C++. I worked on this over several years as a fun challenge. It even has a few concept levels I made. The engine consists of:
- The timing engine, so the game runs at a consistent 60 fps.
- The input manager, gathering keyboard and mouse input.
- The graphics interface, for drawing to the window with double buffering (using Direct2D).
- The audio interface, for playing music and effects (using XAudio2).
- The physics engine, using Box2D.
- The animation engine, for controlling the timing and drawing of sprite animations.
All of these are pieces are wrapped nicely together in this game engine.

The copyright for this project is owned entirely by me, Robert Thorsberg ([rothor](https://github.com/rothor "rothor on GitHub") on GitHub). Libraries used include Box2D, Direct2D, and XAudio2.
